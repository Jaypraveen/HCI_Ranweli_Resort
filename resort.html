                <p>Ranweliâ€™s architecture blends with the unique and rich natural environment. The serene and idyllic location has been fully utilized in the layout of the land, featuring indigenous flora and fauna,and borders the wide sandy beach on one
                    side, and the river on the other.</p>
                <p>land was originally a coconut plantation surrounded by wetlands mainly mangroves. In conceptualizing Ranweli, the architects used the spacing of the rows of the coconut trees (known as the coconut grid by Agriculturists) as the discipline
                    for the design. The bungalows, central areas and facilities were built by removing the minimum number of coconut trees. For each bungalow constructed, only one tree was removed and the tree trunks were used to construct the pillars.</p>
                <p>
                    The connecting walkways open out into beautifully tended palm gardens leading to the heart of the resort. Architecturally and aesthetically the construction and furnishing of the village blends western standards of comfort and with the traditions of indigenous
                    Sri Lankan culture.</p>

                                    <p>Kalpitiya in the North Western coast of Sri Lanka is famous for its Dolphin watching. The ideal time for this is between November to March as it's a migration stop for both Dolphins and Wales. It's one of the best places
                                        to see ever smiling and singing Dolphins. If you are at the right place at the right time the Dolphins in Kalpitiya will give a show in their hundreds and perhaps even in their thousands. During the season there
                                        is a 98% chance of spotting Sperm Whales and Blue Whales as their migration path is just off the shores. Kalpitiya is just over 2 hours drive from Ranweli Holiday Village.
